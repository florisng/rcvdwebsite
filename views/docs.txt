Make me a header with info below:

1. A logo <img src="/images/logo.png" />
2. Home
3. Services
4. Publication
    - Announcement
    - Legal Document
    - Jobs
5. CPD
    - Service Providers
    - CPD Forums
    - CPD Guidelines
6. Registration
    - RCVD Member
    - License
7. About Us
    - RCVD Mandate
    - Board Members
    - Contact Us
8. A button called "Start Learning"

For instance: Publication has a dropdown with Announcement, Legal, document and Jobs links

The logo should be at the left and the nav bar at the right

The header should be fixed when scrolling, backgrdound: #23b14d, color: #fff

Do it elegant and professional with a burger for responsiveness

Remember it's just a div so don't give me any html or body tag
